3.2 Mandatory keywords

3.2.1 CONTENTS
Type: text
Length: 256 characters
Multiline: No

Information about the contents, which makes up the first part of a title
created when retrieving tables from PC-Axis. The text must not exceed 256
characters (before 2002 only 100 chars).

3.2.2 DATA
Type: integer/text
Length: N/A
Multiline: Yes

The keyword DATA must be placed at the end of the file, followed by all the
data cells or if KEYS are used the variable values and all data cells that differ
from 0.

3.2.2.1 File without KEYS

After the key word follows all data cells that belong to the table.
In most cases the cells are written with one record per line in the table. The
number of records will thus be determined by the number of values in the
stub. The length of the records depends upon the number of values in the
heading, and also upon the size of figures.
Table cells that contain a dash, one, two, three, four, five or six dots should
be within quotation marks.

For data without keys it is possible to write all cells in just one record,
terminated by a semicolon.

PC-Axis accepts the delimiters comma, space, semicolon, tabulator. The
different delimiters are synonyms and can be mixed in the file.
Recommended delimiter is space.

3.2.2.2 Files with KEYS

For every variable in the stub is indicated the value for the variable within
quotation marks, comma separated, followed by all data cells for that row
(no quotation marks, space separated).

Whether the text from VALUES or from CODES are used for a variable is
indicated by the keyword KEYS("var")=CODES or
KEYS("var")=VALUES. It is possible to use VALUES from one variable
and CODES for another in the same file.
Rows that only contain 0 (zeros) are excluded from the file

One - six dots
Data that is missing is stored as one, two, three, four, five or six dots.
It is not possible to get a dot or two dots by excluding a value. Thus, you
cannot write 1,,2,3 in order to get 1,".",3,4
For PC-Axis version prior to 2005 a dash is presented as 0 and saved as 0.
Thus, you cannot afterwards find out if the original value was - or 0. Starting
with 2005 PC-Axis keeps track on which cells are â€“ and the keyword
DATASYMBOLNIL can be used to show something else in the table.
How the dots are shown on screen is determined by the keywords
DATASYMBOL1, etc. If these keywords are missing the presentation is
taken from PC-Axis language files.

3.2.2.3 Number of decimals when a file is saved

The keyword DECIMALS determines the number of decimals to be saved. If
the file also contains the key word PRECISION, PC-AXIS saves as many
decimals as corresponds to the largest number specified by DECIMALS or
PRECISION. All cells are stored with the same number of decimals.

3.2.3 DECIMALS
Type: integer [0, 15]
Length: Lines of 256 characters
Multiline: No

The number of decimals in the table cells. 0 - 15. (0-6 if SHOWDECIMALS
is not included). Indicates how many decimals will be saved in the PC-Axis
file. Written without quotation marks. Compare SHOWDECIMALS.

3.2.4 DESCRIPTION
Type: text
Length: N/A
Multiline: Yes

If a file contains DESCRIPTION, when fetching from a disk, this text is used
to show the contents of the disk. C.f. TITLE.

If the user wants to save a file in PC-AXIS and writes a text that describes
the file, this text will be saved as DESCRIPTION. The text will be used to
show the contents of tables in the SUBJECT AREA. The text is not
presented as a note nor in any other way when the table is presented on the
screen unless the keyword DESCRIPTIONDEFAULT is used. In this case
the description is shown instead of the title.

3.2.5 HEADING
Type: text
Length: 256 character per value
Multiline: Yes

At least one of the keywords STUB or HEADING must be included. Usually
both are included, as you choose one or several variables for the stub and the
heading, respectively. The keywords are followed by a list with the chosen
variables. The variables are within quotation marks and separated by
commas. If the list with the variables has to be divided up into several lines,
this should be done after a comma and not within the variable name.

3.2.6 MATRIX
Type: text

Multiline: No

The name of the matrix. Is suggested as file name when the file is fetched.
(new length 2008).

3.2.7 STUB

Type: text
Length: Lines of 256 characters
Multiline: Yes

The title of the table, reflecting its contents and variables. Is not needed if the
file contains DESCRIPTION, in that case the text belonging to description is
used. How the heading of a table will look depends on which variables the
user chooses; the heading thus created will then be saved as TITLE.
(Compare also DESCRIPTIONDEFAULT)
If the file contains DESCRIPTION the text for this key word will be used.

3.2.11 UNITS
Type: text
Length: 256 characters
Multiline: No

Unit text, e.g. ton, index. The text must not exceed 256 characters (new

CODES keyword. Which observation it refers to is given by the key which is
written within parenthesis after the keyword and before the equal sign.
The format of the key is one value code for each variable in the order
indicated by STUB and HEADING starting with the variables in the STUB.

If the attribute key is missing then this will indicate the default values for the
attributes for all measures that do not have any ATTRIBUTES specified.
This is also referred to as the default attributes. The default attributes should
always be specified in order to save space and unnecessary repetition.

Length: N/A
Multiline: No

Indicates if the data table is included in the official statistics of the
organization.

3.3.51 PARTITIONED
Type: complex text
Length: N/A
Multiline: Yes

This is used to partition a variable into levels, for instance
PARTITIONED("region")="municipality",1,4;
PARTITIONED("region")="subarea",5;
states that the first four positions for the regional values contain the
municipality code, and that the subarea code starts in position 5. Thus the
values for the variable region after the key word VALUES must be written in
code, not plain text. Max 3 levels can be used, each gives start position and
length except for the last level where length is implied as rest of the code.

3.3.52 PRECISION

Multiline: No

Can occur for single values. Determines that the value shall be presented
with a number of decimals that differs from the keyword
SHOWDECIMALS. Is to be written as
PRECISION("variable name","value name")=n where n is a figure between 1
and 6. The number of decimals for precision must be higher than the number
of decimals for SHOWDECIMALS to have any effect.

3.3.53 PRESTEXT
Type: integer
Length: N/A
Multiline: No

From PX file format version 2010 and later the definition of PRESTEXT is
changed the prior versions defines it as:
States if texts or codes are shown for the keyword VALUES. Normally a file
is created so that texts are found after the keyword VALUES and codes after
the keyword CODES. This is equivalent to PRESTEXT("variable name")=1;
which is the default. If a user changes presentation from texts to codes and
saves the file the value codes will be saved after the keyword VALUES and
value texts after the keyword CODES. In this case the keyword PRESTEXT is
written as PRESTEXT("variable name")=0. This enables PC-Axis to know if
it is necessary to switch to codes if aggregation is selected. The user can also
decide to show both codes and texts for a value and in this case the keyword
is saved as PRESTEXT("variable name")=2 or PRESTEXT("variable
name")=3. PRESTEXT becomes 2 if it originally was 1 and 3 if it originally
was 0.

In the new definition the PRESTEXT is that it is an integer value between 0-
3 that describes how the value should be presented in a user interface. The
values text should always be defined by the VALUES keyword and the
codes should always be defined by the CODES keyword.
0 - Only the value code should be displayed.
1 - Only the value text should be displayed.
2 - Both code and value should be displayed and the order should be
the code and then the value text.
3 - Both code and value should be displayed and the order should be
the value text then the value code.
Example
VALUES("region")="Albania","Austria",â€¦
â€¦
CODES("region")="AL","AT",â€¦
â€¦
PRESTEXT("region")=2
Since the PRESTEXT is set to 2 the values would be presented as
AL Albania
AT Austria
â€¦

3.3.54 PX-SERVER

Length: 0-1
Multiline: Yes

If rounding is missing then rounding will be done in accordance with
information in the pcax2000.ini file. If the keyword is missing then the
decimal rule in pcax2000.ini is used.

Rounding = 0 means that .5 is rounded up if the previous figure is odd, 1.5 becomes 2.
Rounding = 1 means that .5 is always rounded up. 0.5 becomes 1 and 1.5 becomes 2.

The following formats are used:
A1 for annual statistics written as CCYY (C for century, Y for year)
H1 for halfyear in format CCYYH, where H is 1 or 2
Q1 for quarterly data written CCYYQ, where Q is 1 - 4.
M1 for monthly statistics written CCYYMM
W1 for weekly data written CCYYWW
TIMEVAL is used in PC-AXIS version 1.7 when converting to Aremos and
